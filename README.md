# Introduction to Git

A half-day course providing an introduction to the
[Git version control](https://git-scm.com) system.

<br>

## Course Description

### Overview
[**Git**](https://git-scm.com) is an open source **version control system** for
tracking changes in code and other types of text documents. First released in
2005, Git has become the **de-facto standard** for version control, and is
extensively used in both open source and commercial software development.

Git is not limited to software development, and has proved to be an essential
tool in **reproducible research** - allowing to keep track of files such as
data analysis scripts, pipelines, reports or more generally any text-based
document.

This half-day course gives a short **introduction to Git** and its most useful
commands, as well as an introduction to collaborative workflows using GitHub
through both theory and practical exercises.  
Specifically, **the course will cover the following topics**:
* Brief introduction to version control systems: **Git use case examples**.
* **Git basics**: creating a Git repository and making commits.
* **Git branches**: basic commands to work with branches and introduction to
  branched workflows.
* Working with remotes: **collaborating with GitHub**.
* Collaborative workflows.

Please note that this course focuses exclusively on using Git via
**command line**. This knowledge is then easily transferrable to any GUI
environment (e.g. VS Code, RStudio, etc.).

Details on which Git commands are covered in this course can be found below.

### Course structure - please read carefully :warning:
Because of its limited in-class time (0.5 days), this course requires
participants to **to self-study before and after the class**.

Specifically, this course is structured as follows:
* **Pre-course self-study tasks** (0.5 days):
* **In-class teaching** (0.5 days):
* **Post-course** exercises: a series of exercises to do on your own after the
  class.

You will find all the details to the pre- and post-course tasks in the sections
below.
