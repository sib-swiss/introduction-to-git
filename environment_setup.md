# Version control with Git: setting-up your environment

Please complete the setup instructions given in this document
**before** the start of the course.

In particular:

* Make sure that you have relatively **recent version of Git installed** on
  your computer for the course (version >= 2.23.0 - released in 2019).
* Make sure to **provide us with your GitHub user name** (see point 2. below)
  at the **latest 2 days before** the start of the course.
* For online classes, you should have a computer with a **working microphone**
  as some exercises involve collaboration/communication with other participants.

## 1. Installing Git on your computer

To install Git, please refer to the relevant section below depending on your
operating system. Please make sure to install a relatively
**recent version of Git (2.23.0 or higher)**.

* **Linux:** install Git using your distribution's official package manager.

  * Ubuntu/Debian: `apt-get install git`
  * Fedora/CentOS: `dnf install git`  

* **Windows:** download Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
  and follow the installation instructions.  
  When the installation is complete, open the `Git Bash` application from the
  Windows start menu. This application acts as a small Linux shell (terminal),
  with Git and a few other basic GNU-Linux tools installed (e.g. the `vim` and
  `nano` editors).

* **MacOS:** Download Git from [this link](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
  and follow the installation instructions.  

To test whether your installation was successful, try to run `git help` and
`git --version`.

## 2. Create a GitHub account

[GitHub](https://www.github.com) is a commercial hosting platform for Git
repositories, currently owned by Microsoft.  

We will use GitHub for some of the course exercises, and you will therefore
need a (free) account on GitHub to use during the course.

* If you do not already have a GitHub account, please go to
  [www.github.com](https://www.github.com) and **sign-up for a free account**.
* :fire:
  **IMPORTANT:** once you have created your account,
  **add your name and GitHub user name** to the "GitHub user names" table in
  the shared **document used for the course** (the link to the document will
  be communicated to you via email).
  This is needed so that we can add you to projects we will use during the
  exercises.  
  Please do this **at least 2 days before the start of the course** as it
  sometimes takes a bit of time before the invitations to join a new project
  on GitHub are sent-out.
* The **GitHub user names** table in the shared document will also be used to
  define teams for the collaborative exercises of the course (see the "Team"
  column of the table). If you are participating in the course with
  colleagues, you can register in the same team.
